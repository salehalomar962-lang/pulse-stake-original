# Pulse – Stake Original Game Concept

![Pulse Game Preview]![Pulse Game Preview](./A_promotional_digital_image_for_the_conceptual_game.png)
Pulse is a high-tension, real-time gambling game designed as a Stake Original. Players must tap out before a hidden voltage spike hits as a glowing pulse moves across a voltage line. The longer they hold, the higher their multiplier – but so is the risk.

## 🎮 Game Concept

- **Start Pulse:** Player begins the round by launching a pulse line.
- **Multiplier Grows:** The longer the line moves, the more the multiplier increases.
- **Voltage Spike:** A hidden spike will end the round instantly if touched.
- **Tap Out:** Player can cash out anytime before hitting the spike.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔹 Auto Tap-Out System
- 🔹 Provably Fair with client/server seed verification
- 🔹 Mobile-first, clean UI
- 🔹 High replay value
- 🔹 Leaderboards and in-game challenges

## 📊 Technical Specs

- RTP: 99.0%
- House Edge: 1.0%
