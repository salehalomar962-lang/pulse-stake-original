Pulse is a high-tension, real-time gambling game designed as a Stake Original. Players must tap out before a hidden voltage spike hits as a glowing pulse moves across a voltage line. The longer they hold, the higher their multiplier – but so is the risk.

## 🎮 Game Concept

- **Start Pulse:** Player begins the round by launching a pulse line.
- **Multiplier Grows:** The longer the line moves, the more the multiplier increases.
- **Voltage Spike:** A hidden spike will end the round instantly if touched.
- **Tap Out:** Player can cash out anytime before hitting the spike.
